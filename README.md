**#Data Structures Practice**

This repository contains some of my implementations of important data structures that I have worked on as part of my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).


**Data Structures Covered**

**1. Linked Lists**

~ Singly Linked List

~ Doubly Linked List

~ Singly Circular Linked List

~ Doubly Linked List

**2. Stacks**

~ Stacks Using Array

~ Stacks Using Linked List

~ Stacks Using Queue

Use **g++ SULL.cpp SLL.cpp -o your_program_name** to compile the code for SULL.cpp file.


**3. Queues**

~ Queue Using Array

~ Queue Using Linked List

~ Queue Using Stacks

**Usage**

Clone the repository and navigate to the specific folder of the data structure you want to explore.

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DataStructures.git

**Development Note**

This repository is still a work in progress. Further data structures and optimizations will be added soon as I continue my learning. Stay tuned for updates!


**Purpose**

The code here is meant for learning and practicing data structures, and can be used as a reference by anyone looking to understand these concepts.
