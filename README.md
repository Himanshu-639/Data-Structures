**#Data Structures Practice**\n
This repository contains some of my implementations of important data structures that I have worked on as part of my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

**Data Structures Covered**
**1. Linked Lists**
~ Singly Linked List
~ Circular Linked List
**2. Stacks**
**3. Queues**

**Usage**
Clone the repository and navigate to the specific folder of the data structure you want to explore.
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DataStructures.git

**Development Note**
This repository is still a work in progress. Further data structures and optimizations will be added soon as I continue my learning. Stay tuned for updates!

**Purpose**
The code here is meant for learning and practicing data structures, and can be used as a reference by anyone looking to understand these concepts.
